        <p>It's the thirteenth of march (friday), 2022.<br>
        I wake up and go to school. <br>
<strong>I already had a little bit of experience using HTML/CSS</strong><br>   as my friend had shown me cool things he could do with it.<br>         I also downloaded a startpage for chrome and edited it.<br>            I asked my friend how he learnt all of this and he pointed<br>         me to <em>khan academy.</em>
        I went home and got to work.<br>  
        I did ecerything i could to get better at it and now it <br>        was time to go to sleep.
        </p>

            Day two of HTML/CSS
        </h2>
        
        <p>
            I wake up and get to work. <br>
            I start watching more videos.<br>
            I start doing more challenges.<br>
            I even start work on this internet blog.<br>
            The reason i wanted to do this is to make people understand <br>        How easy it is to start learning something<br>
            as long as you want to learn it. <br>
